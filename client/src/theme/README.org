#+TITLE: Theme

This is the theme of our application - where things like color schemes should be declared.

When writing CSS styles in useStyles, use the theme variables and configuration whenever possible.
This will minimize the number of sources of truth for configuration options in our application - making it super easy to completely change the look of the website.
